Software system design goes beyond just writing code—it requires a structured approach to translating real-world requirements into scalable, maintainable solutions. With Rodrigo Santiago’s hands-on mentoring style and Java Spring expertise, he makes system design accessible to developers at all levels.
Spring System Design in Practice guides you through building robust software architectures with Spring. From breaking down complex business needs into actionable use cases to implementing services using Spring Boot, this book equips you with the tools and best practices needed for developing secure, high-performance applications. You'll explore inter-service communication, security, and aspect-oriented programming to streamline development. Covering microservices architecture, the book demonstrates how to create self-configuring, resilient, and event-driven services that integrate seamlessly into the cloud. Through hands-on experience, you'll apply best practices to enhance reliability and scalability while tackling complex challenges such as state management, resilience patterns, concurrency issues, and distributed transactions—including bottlenecks related to asynchronous and reactive programming.By the end of this book, you'll have the confidence to analyze system requirements and design well-structured, scalable architectures.</details>
